# README

These are notes for ME 400 - Computer Applications in Mechanical
Engineering, taught at Kansas State University.  Some of this material
has been tested over the last two years and has now been thoroughly 
revised and deployed in this format.  Each lecture is a self-contained
Jupyter notebook that students can download, run, modify, and run again.
The entire set of material is also deployed as a website and in PDF
format.
