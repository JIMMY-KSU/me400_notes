    "\n",
    "*From the catalog*: The development and application of computer techniques to the problems of design and analysis in mechanical engineering, including computer programming (abstraction and problem solving; algorithms; control structures; input/output; functions; arrays and array processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "*My informal description*: ME 400 is all about teaching you, the student, how to use programming to solve problems. We’ll use the Python programming language, which is as easy a language to learn as any I’ve encountered. The Python language offers much more with all of the add-on packages available, all for free. What you will come out of the class with, at the least, is (1) a basic ability to understand, implement, and debug computer programs and (2) knowledge of tools (symbolic and numerical) within the Python ecosystem that can be used to solve engineering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Specific objectives* (with corresponding ABET outcomes) include:\n",
    "1. A good understanding of the basics of computer programming [a, e, k]\n",
    "2. Proficiency in the Python programming language [a, k]\n",
    "3. Ability to program from scratch [k]\n",
    "4. Ability to use flow charts and other problem-solving skills [c, e]\n",
    "5. Ability to use basic numerical methods [a, b]\n",
    "6. Ability to use skills learned in ME 400 in later classes and career [e, k]\n"

    "\n",
    "Although there are a plethora of good books on the Python language, there is a sufficient wealth of information online to learn the language without books. Most of the content I’ll present lives in my [online course notes](http://robertsj.github.io/python_for_engineers/index.html). Reading assignments will be based on this material in addition to supplementary material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes are organized by lecture.  Moreover, these notes are written using Jupyter notebooks, a format we'll learn to use about half-way through the course.  However, the notebooks are easy to load and run, and students are encouraged to explore them interactively early in the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the *average* student (with respect to reading and analytical abilities) to earn an *average* grade will require approximately **6 to 9 hours** per week of *study* outside of class.

    "\n",
    "Lectures are an important part of the curriculum and, therefore, are required. Your job is to **come to lecture prepared** to learn and to engage in any in-class activities.  Pre-lecture activities will be assigned for each lecture and must be completed by the start of lecture.  Some lectures may include in-class, formative activities.  Although not formally assessed, these activities will often give an indication of attendance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures in ME 400 will often be best thought of as hands-on, informal tutorials. If you have a laptop, you are encouraged to bring it to class to do in-class examples, ask questions about homeworks, and to write any other code when necessary. If you do not have a laptop, I may have a couple old ones available for in-class use. Use of laptops should be limited to in-class examples and not for surfing and other activities unrelated to the lecture. The use of other electronic devices is distracting and not allowed in lecture.  Should you be found to use such devices in lecture, you may be asked to leave.  "

    "Attendance in laboratory sessions is mandatory.  Laboratories are interactive experiences and cannot be madeup outside of laboratory hours.  Laboratories will be comprised of a quick review and exercises that must be completed within the laboratory session.  Any remaining time may be used to continue on at-home exercises, which will involve in-depth problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students may work in pairs as part of their laboratories.  In some laboratories, formal *pair programming* will be introduced as a learning activity, with specific policies to be described as needed.  However, students should complete homeworks as individual efforts.  (Please also see the discussion below on *plagiarism*).\n",
    "\n",
    "For homework questions, students should *visit office hours* or *use the discussion board*.  If emailed, the course personnel will direct students to the discussion board unless the question is a private matter.

    "## Netiquette and Discussion Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "*Netiquette* is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Here are some points to consider when interacting with your peers while in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Profanity is unprofessional and, therefore, unacceptable in this course.\n",
    "- Avoid using ALL CAPITALS, as it seems to suggest virtual “shouting.”\n",
    "- Although not all online interactions are formal, you should do your best to use proper spelling and grammar. Use of \"textspeak\"is strictly prohibited b/c it is unprofessional imho.\n",
    "- Respect others’ opinions and avoid \"flaming\" (publicly attacking or insulting) your peers. We’re here to learn together, and being nice helps us do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of good netiquette consists of using appropriate language (and structure) in emails (should they be necessary). Here's an example of a suitable (but still informal, say \"business casual\") email:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hi Prof. Roberts,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is my important message.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thanks,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Jane Appleseed\n",
    "\n",
    "In follow-up emails, the greeting (Hi...) and signature (Thanks...) are less important and may be omitted. Some folks might prefer a bit more formality, while some would accept less formality. When interacting with me, the “business casual\" approach is just fine.\n",

    "## Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading for the course is based on the following breakdown:\n",
    "- Pre-Lecture Activities (10%)\n",
    "- Laboratory Exercises (10%)\n",
    "- Homework Exercises (20%)\n",
    "- Examinations (60%)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, the standard 90/80/70/60 rule will be applied for A/B/C/D. These will\n",
    "never be shifted higher, though they may be adjusted lower if deemed appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Lecture Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Students must complete a short, pre-lecture activity prior to each lecture (in this case, due 60 minutes before the start of lecture, which gives me a bit of time to look over responses and understand any common problems).  These activities will most often take the form of an online (Canvas-based) quiz with questions that cover the reading assigned for the lecture in question.  These activities may also include more open-ended responses from students.  In cases where there is a \"right\" answer, students will be given more than one chance to answer the question correctly.  The lowest two scores will be dropped from the calculuted score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Laboratory Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the laboratories is to review and to put in practice the concepts and tools\n",
    "discussed in lecture.  Part of this experience will be laboratory exercises that must be \n",
    "completed in the alotted laboratory time.  There are a total of 13 planned laboratories.  Students may drop their two lowest scores (which can include absences of any kind).  No makeups will be allowed as laboratory exercise solutions will be posted soon after the laboratory session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Each homework extends the topics covered in the laboratory sessions, except for the last \n",
    "laboratory, for which no homework will be assigned.  Hence, there are 12 planned homework\n",
    "assignments.  Students may drop the lowest homework score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All homework is due at 11:59pm on the due date via electronic submission (unless otherwise\n",
    "specified in class).  Unless otherwise announced, this due date will be the Wednesday before the \n",
    "following laboratory (or, in some cases, an exam).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to submit one homework up to 48 hours late for full credit;\n",
    "no late homework is accepted thereafter unless a class-wide extension is given. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: all homework should run without a run-time error.  If running your submission leads immediately to an error, grading becomes very difficult.  In most cases, a homework testing file will be provided with instructions on its use.  Students should use this tool (following the given guidelines) to ensure their programs execute without error or risk automatic point deductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examinations\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important*: any student with a documented disability who requests more time on examinations *must inform me two weeks prior to the examination* or risk forfeiting the accomodation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mid-Term Examinations\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two examinations are in-laboratory examinations and will consist of a written (pen and paper) and coded (Python program, etc.) component.  The written component is to be completed *without notes or any other resources*.  For the coded component, students may use resources to be approved prior to the exam.  The first exam covers roughly the first third of the course.  The second exam emphasizes material from the middle third of the course but should be considered cumulative.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiple laboratory sessions, a number of students will complete an examination after their classmates.  Although all students should expect unique exams, please note that any communication regarding the exam before all exams are submitted is prohibited, and *any violations of this policy will result in an XF in the course*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Examination\n",
    "\n",
    "The final examination consists of only a written component (as sufficient lab space is not likely available) and will be completed in the normal lecture room.  The final exam emphasizes the last third of the course but should be considered cumulative.\n",

    "## Academic Honesty\n",
    "\n",
    "### The University's Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which is presumed\n",
    "to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and\n",
    "without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, ac-\n",
    "knowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor\n",
    "System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses\n",
    "on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can be reached\n",
    "via the following URL: www.ksu.edu/honor . A component vital to the Honor System is the\n",
    "inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course\n",
    "work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: \"On\n",
    "my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic\n",
    "work.\" A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in\n",
    "the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Students in ME 400 are expected to uphold the Honor Pledge.  **Students who are identified to have collaborated on or otherwise received unauthorized assistance on examinations will automatically earn an XF in the course**.   Infractions related to other graded tasks will be judged on a case by case basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming can be hard, and often, students may find that \"copying and pasting\" from the internet is the path of least resistance: *but this can easily lead to plagiarism*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest terms, plagiarism is the act of using the work of someone else as part of your own without saying so. Probably the most common form of plagiarism involves the uncredited borrowing of text (or ideas) in written works (like those reports in Writing 101). However, plagiarism is not just using another’s text verbatim in your report: it includes using someone else’s solution for a problem, whether it comes from another student or a solution manual. This is a particular case of which many engineering students are not aware but may be guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid plagiarizing, the ideas you present in your problem solutions and laboratory reports must be your own. When you adapt the ideas of another, you need to reference those ideas correctly. If you fail to do so, you are committing academic dishonesty, for which the potential penalties are described in the statement below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some basic tips on how to avoid plagiarism in writing, see http://en.writecheck.com/ways-to-avoid-plagiarism.\n",

    "## Students with Disabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in\n",
    "campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu , 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career Advising Center at acac@k-state.edu, 785-826-2649.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations for Classroom Conduct\n",
    "\n",
    "All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article VI, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."
