<div class="section" id="Course-Description-and-Objectives">
<h2>Course Description and Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#Course-Description-and-Objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>From the catalog</em>: The development and application of computer
techniques to the problems of design and analysis in mechanical
engineering, including computer programming (abstraction and problem
solving; algorithms; control structures; input/output; functions; arrays
and array processing).</p>
<p><em>My informal description</em>: ME 400 is all about teaching you, the
student, how to use programming to solve problems. We’ll use the Python
programming language, which is as easy a language to learn as any I’ve
encountered. The Python language offers much more with all of the add-on
packages available, all for free. What you will come out of the class
with, at the least, is (1) a basic ability to understand, implement, and
debug computer programs and (2) knowledge of tools (symbolic and
numerical) within the Python ecosystem that can be used to solve
engineering problems.</p>
<p><em>Specific objectives</em> (with corresponding ABET outcomes) include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A good understanding of the basics of computer programming [a, e, k]</li>
<li>Proficiency in the Python programming language [a, k]</li>
<li>Ability to program from scratch [k]</li>
<li>Ability to use flow charts and other problem-solving skills [c, e]</li>
<li>Ability to use basic numerical methods [a, b]</li>
<li>Ability to use skills learned in ME 400 in later classes and career
[e, k]</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Textbook">
<h2>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#Textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although there are a plethora of good books on the Python language,
there is a sufficient wealth of information online to learn the language
without books. Most of the content I’ll present lives in my <a class="reference external" href="http://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html">online
course notes</a>.
Reading assignments will be based on this material in addition to
supplementary material.</p>
<p>The notes are organized by lecture. Moreover, these notes are written
using Jupyter notebooks, a format we’ll learn to use about half-way
through the course. However, the notebooks are easy to load and run, and
students are encouraged to explore them interactively early in the
course.</p>
<p>Some of the resources from which I might pull supplementary materials
include:</p>

<div class="section" id="Prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#Prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Prerequisite or concurrent: MATH 551. Eventually, this course will
replace MATH 551 with MATH 240/340 as a pre/co-requisite. Ordinary
differential equations are introduced/reviewed as necessary in the last
segment of the course, and supplementary sessions will be offered to
help you brush up on the math skills assumed in this course.</p>
<p>In addition, this course sits in the middle of the MNE undergraduate
curriculum. Consequently, I can count on you having had and to be able
to apply knowledge learned in previous courses. These previous courses
include but are not limited to basic physics and calculus classes. If
something we do in this class requires that previously learned material,
I’ll let you know, but <em>it is your responsibility</em> to review it as
necessary.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: If you are one of our guests from industrial engineering or
another program that does not require MATH 240, let me know by email
within the first week of the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Related-Courses">
<h2>Related Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#Related-Courses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For those seeking knowledge of the C language, consider CIS 209, C
Programming for Engineers. Those who like the material they learn in ME
400 may wish to consider ME 701, Development of Computer Applications in
Mechanical Engineering, which is a course focused on the elements of
scientific computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Amount-of-Study-Required">
<h2>Amount of Study Required<a class="headerlink" href="#Amount-of-Study-Required" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the <em>average</em> student (with respect to reading and analytical
abilities) to earn an <em>average</em> grade will require approximately <strong>6 to
9 hours per week</strong> of <em>study</em> outside of class. Here, to study implies
reading, preparation for lecture, solving homework sets, visiting with
the instructor and GTAs, and anything else that contributes actively to
the learning process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Lectures">
<h2>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#Lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lectures are an important part of the curriculum and, therefore, are
required. Your job is to <strong>come to lecture prepared</strong> to learn and to
engage in any in-class activities. Pre-lecture activities will be
assigned for each lecture and must be completed one hour before the
lecture. Some lectures may include in-class, formative activities.
Although not formally assessed, these activities will often give an
indication of attendance.</p>
<p>The lectures in ME 400 will often be best thought of as hands-on,
informal tutorials. If you have a laptop, you are encouraged to bring it
to class to do in-class examples. If you do not have a laptop, I may
have a couple old ones available for in-class use. Use of laptops should
be limited to in-class examples and not for surfing and other activities
unrelated to the lecture. The use of other electronic devices is
distracting, so turn your phones to vibrate and put them away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Netiquette-and-Discussion-Expectations">
<h2>Netiquette and Discussion Expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#Netiquette-and-Discussion-Expectations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Netiquette</em> is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Here are
some points to consider when interacting with your peers while in this
course:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Profanity is unprofessional and, therefore, unacceptable in this
course.</li>
<li>Avoid using ALL CAPITALS, as it seems to suggest virtual “shouting.”</li>
<li>Although not all online interactions are formal, you should do your
best to use proper spelling and grammar. Use of “textspeak” is
strictly prohibited b/c it is unprofessional imho.</li>
<li>Respect others’ opinions and avoid “flaming” (publicly attacking or
insulting) your peers. We’re here to learn together, and being nice
helps us do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of good netiquette consists of using appropriate language (and
structure) in emails (should they be necessary). Here’s an example of a
suitable (but still informal, say “business casual”) email:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Hi</span> <span class="n">Prof</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">Roberts</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="n">Here</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">important</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">Thanks</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="n">Jane</span> <span class="n">Appleseed</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In follow-up emails, the greeting (Hi…) and signature (Thanks…) are
less important and may be omitted. Some folks might prefer a bit more
formality, while some would accept less formality. When interacting with
me, the “business casual” approach is just fine.</p>
<p>See also the University policy on classroom conduct below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Laboratories-and-Homework">
<h2>Laboratories and Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#Laboratories-and-Homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Attendance in laboratory sessions is mandatory. Laboratories are
interactive experiences and will be comprised of a quick review and
exercises that must be completed within the laboratory session. Any
remaining time may be used to continue on at-home exercises, which will
involve more in-depth problems.</p>
<p>Students <em>will work in pairs</em> as part of their laboratories. In some
laboratories, formal <em>pair programming</em> will be required as a learning
activity, with specific instructions to be given as needed.</p>
<p>However, students should complete homeworks as individual efforts. Let
me be more specific. It is allowed to work informally on assignments,
but the final product (usually, “code”) you submit must be your own. Do
not look at someone else’s code, and do not share your own code. A good
“litmus test” is to ask yourself, “Can I explain everything I’ve
submitted to the instructor?” You’ll be tested based on <em>your</em> knowledge
of programming, so do yourself a favor and complete the homework on your
own. (Please also see the discussion below on the Honor Code and
plagiarism.)</p>
<p>For homework questions, students should <em>visit office hours</em> or <em>use the
discussion board</em>. If emailed, the course personnel will direct students
to the discussion board unless the question is a private matter. The
discussion board is preferred so that (1) a given question need only be
asked (and answered) once, and (2) a record of such questions can be
kept for posterity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Assessment">
<h2>Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#Assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Grading for the course is based on the following breakdown: -
Pre-Lecture Activities (10%) - Laboratory Exercises (10%) - Homework
Exercises (20%) - Examinations (60%)</p>
<p>As a starting point, the standard 90/80/70/60 rule will be applied for
A/B/C/D. These will never be shifted higher, though they may be adjusted
lower if deemed appropriate.</p>
<div class="section" id="Pre-Lecture-Activities">
<h3>Pre-Lecture Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#Pre-Lecture-Activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students must complete a short, pre-lecture activity prior to each
lecture (in this case, due 60 minutes before the start of lecture, which
gives me a bit of time to look over responses and understand any common
problems). These activities will most often take the form of an online
(Canvas-based) quiz with questions that cover the reading assigned for
the lecture in question. These activities may also include more
open-ended responses from students. In cases where there is a “right”
answer, students will be given more than one chance to answer the
question correctly. The lowest two scores will be dropped from the
calculuted score.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Laboratory-Exercises">
<h3>Laboratory Exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#Laboratory-Exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The purpose of the laboratories is to review and to put in practice
the concepts and tools discussed in lecture. Part of this experience
will be laboratory exercises that must be completed in the alotted
laboratory time. There are a total of 12 planned laboratories.</div>
<div class="line">Students may drop their lowest two scores (which can include absences
of any kind). No makeups will be allowed as laboratory exercise
solutions will be posted soon after the laboratory session.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Homework">
<h3>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#Homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each homework extends the topics covered in the laboratory sessions.
Hence, there are 12 planned homework assignments. Students may drop
their lowest two homework scores.</p>
<p>All homework is due at 11:59pm on the due date via electronic submission
(unless otherwise specified in class). Unless otherwise announced, this
due date will be the Wednesday before the following laboratory (or, in
some cases, an exam).</p>
<p>No late homework is accepted unless a class-wide extension is given.</p>
<p>Homework solutions will not be posted, but students may visit office
hours to see the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: all homework should run without a run-time error. If
running a submission leads immediately to an error, grading it becomes
very difficult. In most cases, a homework testing file will be provided
with instructions on its use. Students should use this tool (following
the given guidelines) to ensure their programs execute without error or
risk automatic point deductions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Examinations">
<h3>Examinations<a class="headerlink" href="#Examinations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Important</em>: any student with a documented disability who requests more
time on examinations <em>must inform me two weeks prior to the examination</em>
or risk forfeiting the accomodation. Make-up examinations will be
offered for serious personal (e.g., medical) or</p>
<div class="section" id="Mid-Term-Examinations">
<h4>Mid-Term Examinations<a class="headerlink" href="#Mid-Term-Examinations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first two examinations are in-laboratory examinations and will
consist of a written (pen and paper) and coded (Python program, etc.)
component. The written component is to be completed <em>without notes or
any other resources</em>. For the coded component, students may use
resources to be approved prior to the exam. The first exam covers
roughly the first third of the course. The second exam emphasizes
material from the middle third of the course but should be considered
cumulative.</p>
<p>With multiple laboratory sessions, a number of students will complete an
examination after their classmates. Although all students should expect
unique exams, please note that any communication regarding the exam
before all exams are submitted is prohibited, and <em>any violations of
this policy will result in an XF in the course</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Final-Examination">
<h4>Final Examination<a class="headerlink" href="#Final-Examination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The final examination consists of only a written component and will be
completed in the normal lecture room. The final exam emphasizes the last
third of the course but should be considered cumulative.</p>

<div class="section" id="Contesting-Grades,-etc.">
<h3>Contesting Grades, etc.<a class="headerlink" href="#Contesting-Grades,-etc." title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you wish to request a regrade on any assessed task, you must email
the instructor and GTAs in one email and (1) describe what the task was,

<h3>Extra Credit and End-of-Semester Charity<a class="headerlink" href="#Extra-Credit-and-End-of-Semester-Charity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is no extra credit available in ME 400. The best way to earn
better scores is to ask for help early and often. The end of the
semester (e.g., the last week) is <em>not</em> the time to start getting this
help or to ask for favorable rounding. I repeat: ask for help early and
often.</p>

<div class="section" id="The-University's-Statement">
<h3>The University’s Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#The-University's-Statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity,
which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters,
one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, ac- knowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the
Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in
undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via
distance learning. The honor system website can be reached via the
following URL: www.ksu.edu/honor . A component vital to the Honor System
is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments,
examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor
Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a
student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this
academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic
honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the
reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="My-Statement">
<h3>My Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#My-Statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students in ME 400 are expected to uphold the Honor Pledge. <strong>Students
who are identified to have collaborated on or otherwise received
unauthorized assistance on examinations will automatically earn an XF in
the course</strong>. Infractions related to other graded tasks will be judged
on a case by case basis.</p>

<div class="section" id="On-Plagiarism">
<h3>On Plagiarism<a class="headerlink" href="#On-Plagiarism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Programming can be hard, and often, students may find that “copying and
pasting” from the internet is the path of least resistance: <em>but this
can easily lead to plagiarism</em>.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, plagiarism is the act of using the work of
someone else as part of your own without saying so. Probably the most
common form of plagiarism involves the uncredited borrowing of text (or
ideas) in written works (like those reports in Writing 101). However,
plagiarism is not just using another’s text verbatim in your report: it
includes using someone else’s solution for a problem, whether it comes
from another student or a solution manual. This is a particular case of
which many engineering students are not aware but may be guilty.</p>
<p>To avoid plagiarizing, the ideas you present in your problem solutions
and laboratory reports must be your own. When you adapt the ideas of
another, you need to reference those ideas correctly. If you fail to do
so, you are committing academic dishonesty, for which the potential
penalties are described in the statement below.</p>
