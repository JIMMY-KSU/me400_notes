<div class="section" id="Course-Description-and-Objectives">
<h2>Course Description and Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#Course-Description-and-Objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>From the catalog</em>: The development and application of computer
techniques to the problems of design and analysis in mechanical
engineering, including computer programming (abstraction and problem
solving; algorithms; control structures; input/output; functions; arrays
and array processing).</p>
<p><em>My informal description</em>: ME 400 is all about teaching you, the
student, how to use the computer to solve problems. We’ll use the Python
programming language, which is as easy a language to learn as any I’ve
encountered. The Python language offers much more with all of the add-on
packages available, all for free. What you will come out of the class
with, at the least, is (1) a basic ability to understand, implement, and
debug computer programs and (2) knowledge of tools (symbolic and
numerical) within the Python ecosystem that can be used to solve
engineering problems.</p>
<p>Note, while the central core of this course is about the basics of
programming, the course extends this core content to numerical and other
applications. In other words, do <em>not</em> expect this course to be just
about &#8220;coding.&#8221; I repeat, this is <em>not</em> a &#8220;coding&#8221; course.</p>
<p><em>Specific objectives</em> (with corresponding ABET outcomes) include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A good understanding of the basics of computer programming [a, e, k]</li>
<li>Proficiency in the Python programming language [a, k]</li>
<li>Ability to program from scratch [k]</li>
<li>Ability to use flow charts and other problem-solving skills [c, e]</li>
<li>Ability to use basic numerical methods [a, b]</li>
<li>Ability to use skills learned in ME 400 in later classes and career
[e, k]</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Textbook">
<h2>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#Textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although there are a plethora of good books on the Python language,
there is a sufficient wealth of information online to learn the language
without books. Most of the content I’ll present lives in these <a class="reference external" href="http://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html">online
course notes</a>.
Reading assignments will be based on this material in addition to
supplementary material. Lectures will have standalone slides that
augment the readings.</p>
<p>The notes (and slides) are organized by lecture. Moreover, these notes
are written using Jupyter notebooks, a format that lets you
interactively program in a document-like environment&#8212;all in your
browser. These notebooks are easy to load and run, and students are
encouraged to explore them interactively early in the course.</p>
<p>The primary resource you&#8217;ll need to access beyond the notes is the
documentation for Python, NumPy, and SciPy. Most of what you need will
be right there when we program, but you can also look online at: -
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a> -
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">www.numpy.org</a> -
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org">www.scipy.org</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#Prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Prerequisite or concurrent: MATH 340. Historically, this class required
MATH 551, but we&#8217;ll cover the basics like vectors, matrices,
matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, dot
products, and vector norms along the way.</p>
<p>In addition, this course sits in the middle of the MNE undergraduate
curriculum. Consequently, I can count on you having had and to be able
to apply knowledge learned in previous courses. These previous courses
include but are not limited to basic physics and calculus classes. If
something we do in this class requires that previously learned material,
<em>it is your responsibility</em> to review it as necessary.</p>
<p>Some examples of what I expect you to know: - know that acceleration is
<span class="math">\(a = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\)</span> - know how to balance forces in simple
trusses via free-body diagrams - know how to differentiate and integrate
functions - be able to solve <span class="math">\(\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y(t) = t\)</span> subject
to <span class="math">\(y(0) = 1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Related-Courses">
<h2>Related Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#Related-Courses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For those seeking knowledge of the C language, consider CIS 209, C
Programming for Engineers. Those who like the material they learn in ME
400 may wish to consider ME 701, Development of Computer Applications in
Mechanical Engineering, which is a course focused on the elements of
scientific computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Amount-of-Study-Required">
<h2>Amount of Study Required<a class="headerlink" href="#Amount-of-Study-Required" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the <em>average</em> student (with respect to reading and analytical
abilities) to earn an <em>average</em> grade will require approximately <strong>6 to
9 hours per week</strong> of <em>study</em> outside of class. This is consistent with
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhsecf.html#F115">university
policy</a>,
which suggests 2 outside hours per 1 in-class hour. Here, to study
implies reading, preparation for lecture, solving homework sets,
visiting with the instructor and GTAs, and anything else that
contributes actively to the learning process. Historically, roughly half
the class has earned A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s, meaning the average grade is near the
B/C cutoff.</p>
<p>For the average student, I&#8217;d suggest the following breakdown of
out-of-class work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2 hours per week reading, taking notes, and executing example code</li>
<li>1 hour per week on pre-lecture activities</li>
<li>3&#8211;6 hours per week on homework problems</li>
</ul>
<p>These times indicate <em>real</em>, <em>uninterrupted</em> times. Glancing at the
reading while watching TV, surfing Reddit, etc., will not do much for
one&#8217;s learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Lectures">
<h2>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#Lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lectures are an important part of the curriculum. Your job is to <strong>come
to lecture prepared</strong> to learn and to engage in any discussions and
other activities. Activities will be assigned for each lecture, often as
online quizzes to gauge understanding of the reading prior to lecture.
Some lectures may also include in-class activities; attendence is
necessary to participate in these activities.</p>
<p>The lectures in ME 400 will often be best thought of as hands-on,
informal tutorials. If you have a laptop, you are encouraged to bring it
to class to do in-class examples. If you do not have a laptop, I have
approximately 5 old ones available for in-class use. Use of laptops
should be limited to in-class examples and not for surfing and other
activities unrelated to the lecture. The use of other electronic devices
is distracting, so turn your phones to vibrate and put them away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Netiquette-and-Discussion-Expectations">
<h2>Netiquette and Discussion Expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#Netiquette-and-Discussion-Expectations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Netiquette</em> is a set of rules for behaving properly online. Here are
some points to consider when interacting with your peers while in this
course:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Profanity is unprofessional and, therefore, unacceptable in this
course.</li>
<li>Avoid using ALL CAPITALS, as it seems to suggest virtual “shouting.”</li>
<li>Although not all online interactions are formal, you should do your
best to use proper spelling and grammar. Use of &#8220;textspeak&#8221; is
strictly prohibited b/c it is unprofessional imho.</li>
<li>Respect others’ opinions and avoid &#8220;flaming&#8221; (publicly attacking or
insulting) your peers. We’re here to learn together, and being nice
helps us do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of good netiquette consists of using appropriate language (and
structure) in emails (should they be necessary). Here&#8217;s an example of a
suitable (but still informal, say &#8220;business casual&#8221;) email:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Hi</span> <span class="n">Prof</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">Roberts</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="n">Here</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">important</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">Thanks</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="n">Jane</span> <span class="n">Appleseed</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In follow-up emails, the greeting (Hi...) and signature (Thanks...) are
less important and may be omitted. Some folks might prefer a bit more
formality, while some would accept less formality. When interacting with
me, the “business casual&#8221; approach is just fine.</p>
<p>See also the University policy on classroom conduct below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Laboratories-and-Homework">
<h2>Laboratories and Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#Laboratories-and-Homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Laboratories are interactive experiences and will be comprised of a
quick review and exercises that must be completed within the laboratory
session. Attendance in laboratory sessions is expected, and <strong>credit can
be earned only if you are present</strong>. Any remaining time may be used to
continue on at-home exercises, which will involve more in-depth
problems.</p>
<p>Students <em>will work in pairs</em> as part of some laboratories. In some
laboratories, formal <em>pair programming</em> will be required as a learning
activity, with specific instructions to be given as needed.</p>
<p>However, students should complete homeworks as individual efforts. Let
me be more specific. It is allowed to work informally on assignments,
but the final product (usually, &#8220;code&#8221;) you submit must be your own. Do
not look at someone else&#8217;s code, and do not share your own code. A good
&#8220;litmus test&#8221; is to ask yourself, &#8220;Can I explain everything I&#8217;ve
submitted to the instructor?&#8221; You&#8217;ll be tested based on <em>your</em> knowledge
of programming, so do yourself a favor and complete the homework on your
own. (Please also see the discussion below on the Honor Code and
plagiarism.)</p>
<p>For homework questions, students should <em>visit office hours</em> or <em>use the
discussion board</em>. If emailed, the course personnel will direct students
to the discussion board unless the question is a private matter. The
discussion board is preferred so that (1) a given question need only be
asked (and answered) once, and (2) a record of such questions can be
kept for posterity. Moreover, if a homework is due at 11:59 pm, don&#8217;t
wait until 5 pm to post questions and expect immediate responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Assessment">
<h2>Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#Assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assessment for the course is based on the following breakdown:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Formative Activities (10%)</li>
<li>Laboratory Exercises (10%)</li>
<li>Homework Exercises (20%)</li>
<li>Examinations (60%)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a starting point, the standard 90/80/70/60 rule will be applied for
A/B/C/D. These will never be shifted higher, though they may be adjusted
lower, if deemed appropriate, at the assignment of final grades. My rule
of thumb, subject to change, is that each grade boundary is shifted down
by the average numerical score of the top 5% of the students. Hence, if
the top five scores in a class of 100 students are 100, 99, 98, 97, and
96, their average is 98, and the B cutoff would be shifted down to 78, a
C to 68, etc. This policy protects students overall from an exam
question or homework sets that are particularly challenging (relative to
past semesters). This is applied to the <em>overall</em> score, i.e.,
individual exams or other tasks are not adjusted. Any grade shifts will
be announced during the <em>last week of class</em>.</p>
<p>Three grades are computed in the course, and students keep the best of
these. The grade options are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Option 1</strong> includes <strong>all</strong> formative activities (with three
drops), <strong>all</strong> laboratories (with two drops), Homeworks 1-7 (with
two drops), and Exams 1 and 2. Students can earn <strong>up to a C</strong> with
their Option 1 score.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2</strong> includes <strong>all</strong> formative activities (with three
drops), <strong>all</strong> laboratories (with two drops), Homeworks 1-11 (with
two drops), and Exams 1-3. Students can earn <strong>up to a B</strong> with their
Option 2 score.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3</strong> includes the entire course (with the same drops) and
culminates with the fourth, final examination. <strong>Students can only
earn an A through Option 3</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canvas cannot compute multiple grades! Rather, Canvas will always be set
up to compute the Option 3 score (i.e., the whole course). Students must
keep track of their grade and should verify it with me as needed.</p>
<p>In summary: at the end of the course, we compute three grades for you
corresponding to each option. You keep the best one of the bunch. No
need to let us know!</p>
<div class="section" id="Formative-Activities">
<h3>Formative Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#Formative-Activities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before most (if not all) lectures, students will complete a
&#8220;pre-lecture&#8221; activity. These activities will most often take the form
of an online (Canvas-based) quiz with questions that cover the reading
assigned for the lecture in question. These activities may also include
more open-ended responses from students. In cases where there is a
&#8220;right&#8221; answer, students will be given as many chances as needed to
answer the question correctly. For these cases, &#8220;right&#8221; answers are
automatically shown after the due time. Some lectures will also have
in-class activities (which may be short problems, worksheets, etc.).
These in-class activities can only be completed if you attend the
lecture, and they will not be announced. The <strong>lowest three scores will
be dropped</strong> from the calculuted score, so there are <strong>no make-up
activities</strong>. Hence, if you are absent from class for any reason
(official or not), there is no make-up activity.</p>

<h3>Laboratory Exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#Laboratory-Exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the laboratories is to review and to put in practice the
concepts and tools discussed in lecture. Part of this experience will be
laboratory exercises that must be completed in the alotted laboratory
time. Generally, full credit is earned if students attend the laboratory
and put forth a good-faith effort. There are 12 laboratories.</p>
<p><strong>Students may drop their lowest two scores (which can include absences
of any kind)</strong>. Consequently, <strong>no makeups</strong> will be allowed. You do not

<div class="section" id="Homework">
<h3>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#Homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each homework extends the topics covered in the laboratory sessions.
There are 12 homework assignments. <strong>The two lowest scores are
dropped</strong>.</p>
<p>All homework is due at 11:59pm on the due date via electronic submission
(unless otherwise specified in class). Unless otherwise announced, this
due date will be the Wednesday before the following laboratory (or, in
some cases, an exam). Generally, homework will be posted one week in
advance.</p>
<p>No late homework is accepted unless a class-wide extension is given.</p>
<p>Homework solutions will not be posted, but <em>students may visit office
hours to see the solution</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: all homework should run without a run-time error. If
running a submission leads immediately to an error, grading it becomes
very difficult. A homework testing file will be provided with
instructions on its use. Students should use this tool (following the
given guidelines) to ensure their programs execute without error or risk
automatic point deductions.</p>

<h4>Mid-Term Examinations<a class="headerlink" href="#Mid-Term-Examinations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The three mid-term examinations are in-laboratory examinations and will
consist of a written (pen and paper) and coded (Python program, etc.)
component. Students may use one 8.5&#8217;&#8217; by 11&#8217;&#8217; sheet of hand-written
notes for both components. For the coded component, the internet, past
homeworks, and any other resources are <em>not</em> to be used.</p>
<p>With multiple laboratory sessions, a number of students will complete an
examination after their classmates. Although all students should expect
unique exams, please note that any communication regarding the exam
before all exams are submitted is prohibited, and <em>any violations of
this policy will result in an XF in the course</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Final-Examination">
<h4>Final Examination<a class="headerlink" href="#Final-Examination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The final examination consists of only a written component and will be
completed in the normal lecture room. One sheet of hand-written notes
may be used, but no other resources are allowed. The final exam
emphasizes the last quarter of the course but should be considered
cumulative.</p>

<h4>Accomodations and Make-Up Examinations<a class="headerlink" href="#Accomodations-and-Make-Up-Examinations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Any student with a documented disability who requests more time on
examinations <em>must inform me two weeks prior to the first examination</em>
or risk forfeiting the accomodation.</p>
<p>Make-up examinations will be offered only when absolutely necessary,
e.g., for serious personal issues (e.g., documented illness) or official
school business (e.g., documented conference).</p>

<h3>Contesting Grades, etc.<a class="headerlink" href="#Contesting-Grades,-etc." title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you wish to request a regrade on any assessed task, you must inform a
GTA within 48 hours of when the grade is posted and (1) describe what
the task was, (2) what you think was marked incorrectly, and (3) why you
think your approach was correct. For reference, grades for homeworks
(with automated feedback) and exams (with rubric) are posted the Monday
after their submission. Thus, re-grade requests should generally be
submitted by close of business on the following Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit and End-of-Semester Charity<a class="headerlink" href="#Extra-Credit-and-End-of-Semester-Charity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>only</em> extra credit available in ME 400 is for extra problems on
homeworks and exams. These arise most often when (1) I want to encourage
a problem to be tackled even though it is a bit open ended or difficult,
or (2) when an exam is written with one too many problems and I simply
don&#8217;t want to delete one. These problems are never planned, and
announced only when you see it. In other words, <em>do not plan on extra
credit</em> &#8211; the real world has no analog.</p>
<p>The best way to earn better scores is to ask for help early and often.
The end of the semester (e.g., the last week, or after the final) is
<em>not</em> the time to start getting this help or to ask for favorable
rounding. I repeat: ask for help early and often.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m open to (and actively seek) feedback continuously. However, formal
assessment of the course and its personnel (via TEVALs) will take place
during the final laboratory session, which also serves as a review for
the final exam.</p>

<h3>The University&#8217;s Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#The-University's-Statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity,
which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters,
one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, ac- knowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the
Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in
undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via
distance learning. The honor system website can be reached via the
following URL: www.ksu.edu/honor . A component vital to the Honor System
is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments,
examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor
Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &#8220;On my honor, as a
student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this
academic work.&#8221; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic
honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the
reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="My-Statement">
<h3>My Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#My-Statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students in ME 400 are expected to uphold the Honor Pledge. <strong>Students
who are identified to have collaborated on or otherwise received
unauthorized assistance on examinations will automatically earn an XF in
the course</strong>. Infractions related to other graded tasks will be judged
on a case by case basis.</p>

<div class="section" id="On-Plagiarism">
<h3>On Plagiarism<a class="headerlink" href="#On-Plagiarism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Programming can be hard, and often, students may find that &#8220;copying and
pasting&#8221; from the internet is the path of least resistance: <em>but this
can easily lead to plagiarism</em>.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, plagiarism is the act of using the work of
someone else as part of your own without saying so. Probably the most
common form of plagiarism involves the uncredited borrowing of text (or
ideas) in written works (like those reports in Writing 101). However,
plagiarism is not just using another’s text verbatim in your report: it
includes using someone else’s solution for a problem, whether it comes
from another student or a solution manual. This is a particular case of
which many engineering students are not aware but may be guilty.</p>
<p>To avoid plagiarizing, the ideas you present in your problem solutions
and laboratory reports must be your own. When you adapt the ideas of
another, you need to reference those ideas correctly. If you fail to do
so, you are committing academic dishonesty, for which the potential
penalties are described in the statement below.</p>
