    " \n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore some core features of NumPy and Matplotlib and extend our Python based \"calculator\" to include processing of *arrays* of data.  [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the basic numerical package for Python.  A lot of its utility comes from its numerical, multidimensional array type, :code:`ndarray`. Use of these arrays in a *vectorized* way often leads to significantly faster (and much more compact) code.  Moreover, the array-valued results of numerical computations are  easily visualized using Matplotlib, which was originally developed to provide MATLAB-like graphics in the Python environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I think it's so important that students can create, process, and display data that I highlight it early in the course and revisit it throughtout.  NumPy and Matplotlib together provide about the easiest way to work with data.\n",

    "The difference between these approaches is in how we use the `numpy` module.  Built in to `numpy` are a number of same functions we saw in `math`, e.g., `sin`.  Hence, we could use `numpy.sin(1.0)`, but if we import `numpy` as `np`, we would use `np.sin(1.0)`.  I recommend the latter because (1) it is shorter and (2) most online documentation uses the `np` abbreviation.\n",
