    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll extend our Python based \"calculator\" to include processing of *arrays* of data.  By using NumPy, we get access to a very powerful, vectorized tool, and with Matplotlib, we can easily create professional looking graphics.  I think it's so important that students can create, process, and display data that I highlight it early in the course and revisit it throughtout.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore some core features of NumPy and Matplotlib. In fact, you already saw these two packages action in the first homework. NumPy is the basic numerical package for Python.  A lot of its utility\n",
    "comes from its numerical, multidimensional array type, :code:`ndarray`. Use of these arrays in a *vectorized* way often leads to significantly faster code.  Moreover, the array-valued results of numerical computations are  easily visualized using Matplotlib, which was originally developed to provide MATLAB-like graphics in the Python environment.\n",

    "NumPy is not part of Python, but it is a well-supported package.  You've\n",
    "already installed it if you completed the first module.  Like all\n",
    "packages, we can import NumPy via \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these approaches is in how we use the `numpy` module.  Built in to `numpy` are a number of same functions we saw in `math`, e.g., `sin`.  Hence, we could use `numpy.sin(1.0)`, but if we import `numpy` as `np`, we would use `np.sin(1.0)`.  I recommend the latter because (1) it is shorter and (2) most online documentation uses the `np` abbreviation.\n",

    "we have, e.g., from measurements,  or perhaps we're trying to plot that \n",
