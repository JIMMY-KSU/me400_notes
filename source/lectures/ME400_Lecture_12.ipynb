    "For our purposes, a function is something that is executed (possibly with input) and provides some sort of output. Often, this output will be a value (or several values) explicitly returned by the function. However, functions can also be used to modify the very data given to them as input. Although youâ€™ve been using functions all along (e.g., those provided by the math module like `math.cos`), you'll understand how to define and use your own functions by the end of this lesson.\n",

    "This short program is specific to the value of `x` defined.  If it were to be applied for any value of `x`, it must first be turned into a function.  Functions, like conditional statements and loops, are defined in Python using a special *keyword*.  The basic structure is as follows:\n",

Each argument name (e.g., `arg1`) can be used within the function like normal variables.  After all computations are performed, the function can include a `return` statement with zero or more *return values* (e.g., `rval1`).  As observed for `if`, `while`, and `for` statements, the block of code following the `def` line must be indented. \n",
