    "In  [Lecture 1](ME400_Lecture_1.ipynb), we saw several examples of the form `a = 1`, where the variable `a` is *assigned* the value `1`.  Here, `=` is the *assignment* operator.  The entire line of code `a = 1` is a *statement*.  A statement represents an instruction that is performed by the computer (and, in this case, the Python interpreter). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other operators in the Python language, including those known as the arithmetic operators summarized in the table below.  In the table, `a` and `b` can assumed to be `int` variables (though all but the last operator can be used for `float` variables).  One example is the addition operator, which can be used as `a + b`.  This fragment of code is an *[expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html)*, which is any combination of values, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated, i.e., has a value.  Expressions are distinct from statements.  For example, `a + b` is an expression (defines a value), but `c = a + b` is a statement (in this case, assignment of a value to a variable `c`).\n",
