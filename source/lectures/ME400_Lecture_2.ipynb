    "## Python Operators \n",
    "\n",
    "In  [Lecture 1](ME400_Lecture_1.ipynb), we saw several examples of the form `a = 1`, where the variable `a` is *assigned* the value `1`.  Here, `=` is the *assignment* operator.  The entire line of code `a = 1` is a *statement*.  A statement represents an instruction that is performed by the computer (and, in this case, the Python interpreter).   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other operators in the Python language, several important ones of which are summarized in the table below.  In the table, `a` and `b` can assumed to be `int` variables (though all but the last operator can be used for `float` variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "| symbol | example use | definition | \n",
    "|--------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| `+`    | `a + b`     | add `b` to `a`         |\n",
    "| `-`    | `a - b`     | subtract `b` from `a`  |\n",
    "| `*`    | `a * b`     | multiply `a` by `b`    |\n",
    "| `/`    | `a / b`     | divide `a` by `b`      |\n",
    "| `//`   | `a // b`    | divide `a` by `b` *using integer arithmetic* |\n",
    "| `%`    | `a % b`     | remainder of `a / b` |\n",
    "| `**`   | `a**b`      | raise `a` to the power of `b` |\n",
    "| `^`    | `a^b`       | [bitwise exclusive or](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=xor#binary-bitwise-operations) |\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four operators are pretty straightforward and are the same symbols used in a variety of programming languages and other tools (e.g., common spreadsheets).  The remaining four warrant some elaboration.  The operator `//` corresponds to integer division.  Essentially, integer division rounds the final result *down* to the nearest integral value.  Here's a quick example for illustration:"
