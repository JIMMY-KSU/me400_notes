    " \n",
    "In [Lecture 5](ME400_Lecture_5.ipynb), the basics of programming logic were introduced, including the idea of *iteration*. The emphasis here and in [Lecture 9](ME400_Lecture_9.ipynb) is on the logic of *iteration* and its implementation via `while` and `for` loops in Python.  To proceed, one must be comfortable with the theoretical coverage of iteration presented in [Lecture 5](ME400_Lecture_5.ipynb).\n",
