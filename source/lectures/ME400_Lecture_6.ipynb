    "In this lesson, we turn back to Python and begin the development of more complicated programs.  The emphasis here and in [Lecture 7](ME400_Lecture_7.ipynb) is on the logic of *selection* and its implementation via conditional statements in Python.  Effective use of conditional statements requires a thorough understanding of the relational and logical operators defined in [Lesson 2](ME400_Lecture_2.ipynb).  Of course, one must also first be comfortable with the theoretical coverage of selection presented in [Lecture 5](ME400_Lecture_5.ipynb).\n",

    "This example illustrates the basic syntax of `if` statements, and four key observations can be made:\n",
    "1. The `if` statement begins with the keyword `if`.  Because `if` is a keyword, we can't use it as a name for variables.  Rather, `if` can only be used for `if` statements.\n",
    "2. The *condition* is `number < 0`, which is an expression relating `number` and `0` by the `<` relational operator.  In other words, `number < 0` is either `True` or `False`.  When `True`, the statement immediately following the `if` statement is executed.  Otherwise, that line (here, the one with `print`) is skipped.\n",
    "3. Immediately after the condition is a `:` (i.e., a colon).  This **colon is required** and indicates the end of the `if` statement.  There **is no then** in Python.\n",
    "4. The line immediately after the `if` statement (the one with `print`) is **indented**.  Here, that indentation consists of four spaces.  At least one space is required, but **four spaces is most common and recommended for all indentation**.  Moreover, all lines in the same block of code (e.g., the lines optionally executed if the condition of an `if` statement is satisfied) must have the same indentation.   Such a block of code is called a \"suite\" in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html)."

    "print(root1, root2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  *Solution*: Actually, it doesn't do anything but lead to errors!  First, the Python interpreter catches that the `if` statement is missing its colon.  If that gets fixed, the interpreter then catches that the indentation is not uniform in the block of code immediately following the `if`.  Both `root1` and `root2` should start in the same column, but `root2` starts one column before `root1`.  Finally, for the particular values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `b**2` is less than `4*a*c`, and the condition is *not* satisfied.  Hence, neither `root1` nor `root2` are defined, and the `print` statement is therefore using undefined names.  \n",

    "This solution is logically equivalent to  the `if`/`else` version, but it is a bit more complex.  First, the total amount of code is a bit larger because we need to explicitly define a second condition.  Moreover, because we have to define that condition explicitly, we have increased the chance of introducing a logical error (or \"bug\") into our program.  For instance, if we accidentally had set the second condition to `number > 0`, which might seem right at first glance, the result would not be equivalent because the case in which `number == 0` would be missed.\n",

    "if not a%2:\n",
    "      a += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "> *Solution*: They might look equivalent, but they are not.  In Option 1, `a%2` is 1, so `a -= a%2` is executed, and with the result that `a == 8`.  The `else` block is skipped.  In Option 2, `a%2` is again 1, and so `a -= a%2` is executed and `a == 8` after the first `if`.  However, now the second condition `not a%2` is *also satisfied*, meaning that `a += 1` is executed, and `a == 9` at the end.  Hence, any time the variables that show up in the condition of an `if` statement are modified, future conditions involving those same variables may have different values.  We could make Option 2 equivalent to Option 1 by using a temporary variable, e.g., `b = a - a%2` and `b = a + 1`, in each `if` statement, and then set `a = b` after both statements.  Kind of ugly, no?  But possible!"
