    "In this lesson, we turn back to Python and begin the development of more complicated programs.  The emphasis here and in [Lecture 7](ME400_Lecture_7.ipynb) is on the logic of *selection* and its implementation via conditional statements in Python.  Effective use of conditional statements requires a thorough understanding of the relational and logical operators defined in [Lesson 2](ME400_Lecture_2.ipynb).  Of course, one must also first be comfortable with the theoretical coverage of selection presented in [Lecture 5](ME400_Lecture_5.ipynb).\n",

    "This example illustrates the basic syntax of `if` statements, and four key observations can be made:\n",
    "1. The `if` statement begins with the keyword `if`.  Because `if` is a keyword, we can't use it as a name for variables.  Rather, `if` can only be used for `if` statements.\n",
    "2. The *condition* is `number < 0`, which is an expression relating `number` and `0` by the `<` relational operator.  In other words, `number < 0` is either `True` or `False`.  When `True`, the statement immediately following the `if` statement is executed.  Otherwise, that line (here, the one with `print`) is skipped.\n",
    "3. Immediately after the condition is a `:` (i.e., a colon).  This **colon is required** and indicates the end of the `if` statement.  There **is no then** in Python.\n",
    "4. The line immediately after the `if` statement (the one with `print`) is **indented**.  Here, that indentation consists of four spaces.  At least one space is required, but **four spaces is most common and recommended for all indentation**.  Moreover, all lines in the same block of code (e.g., the lines optionally executed if the condition of an `if` statement is satisfied) must have the same indentation.   Such a block of code is called a \"suite\" in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html)."

    "To get comfortable with the basic `if`-statement structure, it is worth exploring a few examples:\n",
    "- Suppose `a` and `b` are numbers already defined.  Use an `if` statement to swap their values when `b` is less than `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Solution**:\n",

    "if b < a:\n",

    "      print(\"The answer is 42.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Solution**: It prints out \"The answer is 42.\" To know that, however, requires you can evaluate the condition.  Remember that the order of operations is important.  First `not`, then `and`, and finally `or` is applied.  The result is `True` (since `not 0` equals `True`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What does this code do?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import sqrt # one can selectively import functions from modules\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 # yes, you can assign several variables like this!\n",
    "if b**2 > 4*a*c\n",
    "      root1 = (-b + sqrt(b**2 > 4*a*c))/(2*a)\n",
    "     root2 = (-b - sqrt(b**2 > 4*a*c))/(2*a)\n",
    "print(root1, root2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  **Solution**: Actually, it doesn't do anything but lead to errors!  First, the Python interpreter catches that the `if` statement is missing its colon.  If that gets fixed, the interpreter then catches that the indentation is not uniform in the block of code immediately following the `if`.  Both `root1` and `root2` should start in the same column, but `root2` starts one column before `root1`.  Finally, for the particular values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `b**2` is less than `4*a*c`, and the condition is *not* satisfied.  Hence, neither `root1` nor `root2` are defined, and the `print` statement is therefore using undefined names.  "
