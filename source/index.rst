Python for Engineers
====================

*Python for Engineers* is a collection of three, one-credit classes that
teach students of engineering and other technical displines how to use
Python to solve problems.  The sequence begins with *Python from Scratch*,
which introduces the fundamentals of the Python language along with 
use of NumPy and Matplotlib for simple computations and plotting.  
The subsequent courses (to be formalized) will focus on symbolic computing, 
more advanced use of NumPy and SciPy for solving ODE's, linear
systems, nonlinear systems, optimization, and other topics, all from with 
the Python ecosystem.  

Why Python?
-----------

Python has long been in many scientists' "toolboxes,"
and it is now the most popular first language in top
computer science programs (notably MIT and Carnegie Mellon; 
see, e.g., `this article <http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-
is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-
universities/fulltext>`_).  Here's a 
`well-articulated explanation <http://lorenabarba.com/blog/why-i-push-for-python/>`_ 
on why Python offers a good alternative to more traditional first languages 
like C/C++ and Java.  I was once a heavy MATLAB user, too, and I still 
use C++ (and sometimes Fortran, and even less frequently, the 
MATLAB-like Octave) for scientific applications.  However, for 90% or so of the 
things I do, the reduced time I spend writing code in Python far outweighs
any performance lost relative to a compiled language.


I hope these classes and the Python language
are useful to you.
