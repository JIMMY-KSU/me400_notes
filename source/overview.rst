Prologue
========

These materials were created to support the instruction of engineering
students learning programming for the first time.  The language throughout
is Python.  The materials are evolving, but the general organization of
the content can be divided into four basic categories: (1) the use of 
Python and supporting modules as an interactive, graphical calculator; (2) 
basic programming concepts (e.g., conditionals and loops) and their
implementation; (3) more advanced topics like modular programming and
unit testing; and (4) applications that include symbolic computation,
data analysis (e.g., curve fitting), and numerical solution of 
differential equations.


Why Python?
-----------

Python has long been in many scientists' "toolboxes,"
and it is now the most popular first language in top
computer science programs (notably MIT and Carnegie Mellon; 
see, e.g., `this article <http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-
is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-
universities/fulltext>`_).  Here's a 
`well-articulated explanation <http://lorenabarba.com/blog/why-i-push-for-python/>`_ 
on why Python offers a good alternative to more traditional first languages 
like C/C++ and Java.  I was once a heavy MATLAB user, too, and I still 
use C++ (and sometimes Fortran, and even less frequently, the 
MATLAB-like Octave) for scientific applications.  However, for 90% or so of the 
things I do, the reduced time I spend writing code in Python far outweighs
any performance lost relative to a compiled language.
